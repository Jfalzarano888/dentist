            <h2 style="font-size: 48px; line-height: 20px;"> Your Smile Is Very Important to Us </h2>
            <p style="line-height: 30px; font-size: 18px; text-align: center;"> Dr. Kaga is now offering additional services to help improve and enhance your smile! Botox and dermial fillers are as essential to esthetic dentistry as are porcelain veneers and composite resins. The soft tissues around the mouth are as important as the color and position of the teeth in determining the patient's smile. When we look at our smiles we focus on our teeth and forget that we also need the perioral areas around the mouth to look as good as the teeth for complete smile analysios and esthetic treatment. How many times have you seen beautiful teeth that are surrounded by wrinkled and thin lips and deep nasolabial folds? Your dentist may have given you beautiful teeth, but they have not given you a beautiful smile! Call today for a complementary consultation with Dr. Kaga!</p>
