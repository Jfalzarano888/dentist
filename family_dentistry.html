            <h2> What is Sleep Apnea? </h2>

          <div class="silentnite">
              <h2> Silent Nite SL Technology </h2>
              <p>Silent Nite sl is a custom-fabricated dental device that moves the lower jaw into a forward position, increasing space in the airway tube and reducing air velocity and soft tissue vibration. Special Slide-Link connectors are attached to transparent flexible upper and lower forms. The forms are custom laminated with heat and pressure to the dentistâ€™s model of the mouth. The fit is excellent and comfortable, permitting small movements of the jaw (TMJ) and allowing uninhibited oral breathing. </p>

            <h2> Reduce Apnea Affects </h2>
            <p> There are ways to reduce the effect of sleep apnea. If you or a loved one has sleep apnea, call and ask about our cutting-edge oral appliances that keep airways open during sleep. </p>

          <div class="why">
            <h2> What Causes Snoring?</h2>
            <p> During sleep, muscles and soft tisues in the throat and mouth relax, shrinking the airway. This increases the velocity of airflow during breathing. As the velocity of required air is increased, soft tissues like the soft palate and uvula vibrate. The vibrations of these tissues result in "noisy breathing" or snoring. For majority of snorers, the most affordable, noninvasive, comfortable and effective snoring solution remains a dentist-prescribed snore prevention deveice, such as <b>Silent Nite sl.</b> </p>

          <div class="dangerous">
            <h2> Is It Dangerous? </h2>
            <p> It is estimated that more than 90 million North Americans snore. Taking into account the snorer's spouse and children, as many as 160 million people are negatively affected by snoring. Not only does it disrupt your sleep cycle, it also results in soaring blood pressure. At certain levels of severity, complete blockage of the airway space by the soft tissues and the tongue can occur. If this asphyxiation lasts longer than 10 seconds, it is called Obstructive Sleep Apnea. </p>
